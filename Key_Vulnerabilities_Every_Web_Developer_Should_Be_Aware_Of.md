The internet has become an indispensable source of information for people seeking business, product, or service-related details. Websites often serve as the first impression of a business and the initial mode of communication. With the collection of valuable data online, including transaction records and user information, websites have become integral to corporations. However, they also present a vulnerability.

Despite efforts to enhance website security, hackers continuously develop new methods to identify weaknesses and breach systems. Therefore, maintaining cybersecurity is crucial. Web Application Security Training can provide valuable insights into the threats that web developers should be aware of.

In this blog, we will explore specific cybersecurity threats that web developers should understand.

***WannaCry***

In May 2017, a ransomware worm called WannaCry rapidly spread across various computer networks. The exact purpose of WannaCry's functionality remains somewhat unclear. Even after successful infection, it does not immediately encrypt files. Instead, it first attempts to access a lengthy, gibberish URL. If it can access this domain, it self-locks.

Some experts believe this step was intended to gain an advantage in the attack, while others, like British security researcher Marcus Hutchins, suggest it was meant to complicate code interpretation.

***Injection Flaws***

Injection flaws enable attackers to introduce malicious code within an application to manipulate a different system. These attacks can take various forms, such as shell commands, system calls, or accessing backend databases through SQL injection.

Attackers provide untrusted input to a program, which is processed by an interpreter as part of a command or query, altering the program's execution. Scripts written in various languages can be injected into poorly designed applications and executed.

***Session Hijacking Attack***

When users log into a website, each is assigned a "session ID" that remains active for a specified duration during data transmission.

In a session hijacking attack, the attacker exploits an active session between a victim and the server to interfere with another user's session, intercepting information during transmission.

***Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability Attack***

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a common technique used by hackers to access users' confidential information. It is a highly dangerous and malicious attack that capitalizes on application vulnerabilities to gain access to a user's browser.

XSS attacks target users of vulnerable applications, with two primary types: Stored XSS and Reflected XSS.

***Broken Authentication***

This type of attack allows the attacker to capture or bypass the authentication methods employed by a web application. The objective is to take control of a user's account and exploit the same privileges.

These attacks occur due to various reasons, such as vulnerable session IDs, predictable login credentials, unprotected user authentication data, inactive session timeouts, and insufficient encryption during data transmission.

**Conclusion**

hackers target web applications to steal sensitive online data, extort individuals, commit financial crimes, disrupt society, and damage a company's reputation. Cybercrime can inflict significant harm on a company, impacting its economy, products, and customers. Developers should always look forward to have precautionary measures in place to minimize the chances of a successful attack.
